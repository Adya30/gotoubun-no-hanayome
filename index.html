                        <h2>Gotoubun No Hanayome</h2>
                        <p>One day during his lunch break, Uesugi argues with a female transfer student who has claimed "his seat," leading both of them to dislike each other. That same day, he is presented with a golden opportunity to clear his family's debt: a private tutoring gig for a wealthy family's daughter, with a wage of five times the market price. He accepts the proposal, but is horrified to discover that the client, Itsuki Nakano, is the girl he confronted earlier!</p>

                <p>Fuutarou is a hardworking and intelligent student who comes from a poor family. He is blunt, socially awkward, and initially insensitive to others feelings. His main motivation is to earn money to support his family, which leads him to become the tutor of the Nakano quintuplets. Over time, Fuutarou learns the importance of empathy, emotional connection, and trust. His growth from a cold, goal-oriented person into someone who genuinely cares about others is central to the story.</p>
